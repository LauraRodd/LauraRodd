# Hi, I'm Laura 🙋🏽‍♀️

I'm a self-taught Web Developer who is passionate about creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences. My main interests lie on learning new technologies and bringing unique ideas into life. I enjoy converting mockups into highly-functioning and responsive websites and building web applications. My passion for Web Development and Data has evolved from a curiosity for learning how things work in the digital world, how to solve problems and how to help businesses reach their goals. Usually you can find me learning new technologies to apply to my projects, or writing for my *soon* to be travel blog.
