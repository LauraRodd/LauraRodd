# Hi, I'm Laura 🙋🏽‍♀️

I'm a self-taught Front-End Developer who is passionate about creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences. My main interests lie on learning new technologies and bringing unique ideas into life. I enjoy converting mockups into highly-functioning and responsive websites and building web applications mostly with [React](https://reactjs.org/), which is my favourite framework at the moment😁. My passion for Web Development has evolved from a curiosity for learning how things work in the digital world, how to solve problems by programming and how to help businesses reach their goals. Usually you can find me learning new technologies to my apply to my projects, or writing for my *soon* to be travel blog.
