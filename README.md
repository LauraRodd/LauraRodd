# Hi, I'm Laura 🙋🏽‍♀️

I'm a Content Designer, UX Writer, and UX-minded Web Specialist with a passion for creating clear, useful, and accessible digital experiences.

I focus on shaping intuitive content systems and user-centered design solutions that make complex products easier to understand and use. With a background that blends content strategy, technical writing, and web development, I love bridging the gap between people and technology—whether that’s through clean UI copy, scalable content ops, or thoughtful information architecture.

💡 My work spans:

✍️ UX Writing & Content Design

🧠 Content Strategy & Governance

🌐 Web & CMS Management

📘 Technical Writing & Documentation

🧰 Figma, Adobe Creative Suite

💻 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS basics)

I'm also a lifelong learner who enjoys simplifying technical concepts, building documentation frameworks, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to improve digital products.

Currently, I'm diving deeper into AI-assisted content creation, exploring how automation and prompt engineering can streamline UX writing and content ops. I'm always learning—whether it's a new tool, design system, or ways to make content more inclusive and accessible.
